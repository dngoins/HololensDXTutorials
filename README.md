### C++
   **Recording Audio** - When you Air Tap, sounds from the Microphone are recorded and saved as a WAVE file format into the media folder. You can retrieve the file using the Microsoft HoloLens UWP application (can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store) or the Hololens internal Developer Web Portal.

**Displaying 3D like Text** - This example is a simple example of how text can be displayed in 3D utilizing [my forked DirectXTK (DirectX ToolKit) repo](https://github.com/dngoins/DirectXTK "Dwight's DirectXTK"). The sample uses the SpriteBatch and SpriteFont classes, along with MakeSpriteFont utility to display the words "TEST WORDS" in 3D.
